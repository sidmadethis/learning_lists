import pizza2

pizza2.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
pizza2.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')


# this was to show how modules work. the import statement looks for pizza2.py, and sees the function make_pizza.  when you run making_pizzas2 the import statement works behind the scenes and you get the correct output.  similar to import in node?
